## Welcome to Projetos-em-C (C Projects)

This is a repository with all C programs and algorithms made during my undergratuation. With time, all codes will be upgraded and didatic videos will be produced. Main goals:

- Share knowledge;
- Turn code access (and explanations) more easy;
- Estimulate open access to developed codes and projects in academy;
- Source of study.

The repository is divided on four main parts:
- Algorithms (Basics of programming, variables and constants, I/O funcions, conditional structures, repetition structures, vectors, matrix, function and procedures);
- Data structures (Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, binary search, AVL trees, graphs, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Data research and classification (sorting algorithms, external sort, hash tables, compressing algorithms).
- Applications and algorithms (generic lists, graphs, cryptography, special topics on algorithms).

For C codes, some patterns are being followed:
- In every file, the first line contain an simple explanation about the code. Second line has the subject. the third line shows the author.
- For each new modification made by other authors, it is essential to include the author name in the next ilnes.

If anyone have changes to do, sugestions to make or proposals to add, please, feel free to help :)
